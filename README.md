# ccalculator

this small C program reads basic expressions from a file and outputs the result of the expression. <br />

it supports the four basic operations (+, -, *, /) and parenthesis ordering. <br/>

it was my first attempt at building an interpreter for my programming language, but since it would be hard to write anything more complex with the same approach I am starting from scratch with a more structured codebase.
